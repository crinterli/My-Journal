### Things I Learned Today

- commit: a snapshot of your repository that is entered into permnanent history
- git add < file> (or just do git add * and it automatically adds everything from the folder you're in)
- adding files to git creates an intial repository 
- **TO EDIT EXISTING FILE: first: git add file, then: git commit -m "description", finally: git push origin master to upload everything**
- make changes on computer, then push them up to git hub 
- git diff --staged: lets you check and see your changes
