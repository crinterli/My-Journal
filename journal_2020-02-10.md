### Things I Learned Today:

- GUI: graphical user interface (made to make it easier to interact with the content of the computer, but creates a layer)
- directory: technical term for folder
- **C://Users/crint/Documents/Geneseo/Junior%20Year/Spring/ENG%20340/journal** 
    (%20 appears where a space is)
- http://somedoman.org/path/to/page
- pdf: portable document format
- plain text is useful b/c it takes up little space & is easily transformable 
- plain text/code important for accessibility b/c screen readers can read it easily but they have a harder time with files like pdf
- Markup: simplified *symbolic* formatting for plain text; a language for describing content in a text file, mainly for the purpose of presentation on the web 
- Shortcuts for coding: 
    <p>paragraph<p>
    <img src="path/to/file.jpg" />
    <hl>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <a href="http://geneseo.edu">Geneseo</a>
