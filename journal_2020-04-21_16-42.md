### DIY TEI

- < add (something that was added)
- < del> (something that was deleted)
- for TEI to display in a browser, it would have to be transformed into HTML and possibly also with CSS
- TEI only tells computer how to interpret the text
- insertions and deletions can be nested inside each other
- msDesc (description of the manuscript/repository)
- replace the identifier of your text
- can have gaps for parts that are unreadable or what you *think* a word is
- make sure to encode the last word
