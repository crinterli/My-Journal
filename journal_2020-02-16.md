### Chapter 6 Notes

- history of the telegraph to phone to electric communication
- "hated the numbing, wasteful labor of mere calculation. 'A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures... He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgement'" (172)
- "Genes, as he noted, were a theoretical construct" (175)
- "The invention of writing had catalyzed logic, by making it possible to reason about reasoning--to hold a train of though up before the eyes for examination--and now, all these centuries later, logic was reanimated with the invention of machinery that could work upon symbols" (177)
- "Epimenides' paradox...is the liar's paradox. *This statement is false*...one grasps the idea and moves on--because life and language lack the perfection, the absolutes, that give them force" (179)
- "'the whole form of words is just noise without meaning'" (180)
- "*Mechanical* rules: for the logic operated inexorably, with no room for varying human interpretation. Its symbols were drained of meaning. Anyone could verify a prooff step by step, by following the rules, without understanding it" (182)
- "Incompleteness was real. It meant mathematics could never be free of self-contradiction" (185)
- "The initial phase of ignorance and sketpicism passed in an eyeblink. The second phase of amusement and entertainment did not last much longer. Business quickly forgot their qualms about the device's seriousness. Anyone could be a telephone prophet now" (191)
- "To enable the fast motivation of this extraordinary network, the telephone demanded new technologies and new science" (192)
"'The telephone remains the acme of electrical marvels... No other thing foes so much with so little energy. No other thing is more enswathed in the unknown'" (196)
"They were contemplating not just words but also sounds and images. They were representing the whole world as symbols in electricity" (203)
