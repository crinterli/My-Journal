### Things I Learned Today:

- Markup language is the "language used for formatting on the web" (i.e. html)
- HTML: markup language used to organize and create website content
- CSS: language used for design and layout
- Most websites are plain text documents
- “HTML tells the browser what the different parts of a document are. CSS tells the browser what the parts of the document should *look like*.”
