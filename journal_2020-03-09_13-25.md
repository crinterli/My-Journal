### Things I Learned Today

- list of series of things using comma seperated strings; need quotation marks around strings to do anything with them
- if you have string and integers, it won't try to do math but rather integrate them
- food = ["cake", "ice cream", "candy"],  then 
for food in food 
print("I" + " like " + food), the output will be: 
I like cake 
I like ice cream 
I like candy
