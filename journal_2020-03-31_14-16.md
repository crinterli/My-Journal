### *The Remaking of Walden* Notes
- "Ralph Waldo Emerson, who had played a large and generous part in fostering Thoreau's literacy career during the preceding decade"
- "Wladen alternating with a critique contemporary culture, and more the sum of his histories simultaneously present in a text at once fabular, mythic, scientific, and even scriptural in its dimensions"
- his first book, "*A Week* received little publicity... Thoreau found himself liable for...nearly a year's ordinary wages...more than seven hundred unsold copies swelling the shelves of his own small personal library"
- he went through a constant state of revision and editting over a period of years
- "their very abundance and variety make categorizing and generalizing the revisions extrememly difficult"
- "final version incorporates the earlier versions in a very complex manner, not superseding them...subtly transforming them while often leaving individual passages relatively intact"
- "if some of the portions that were added during this phase conflict with assertions made in earlier versions, it is a mark of Thoreau's maturity as a writer and a thinker that he allowed such inconsistencies to stand"
- "means of a characteristic wordplay to the writer's awareness of the difference between his immediate and his later, mediated vision"
- "an expression of the belief that the study of nature is ultimately the study of the self, for it is only after many years of observation that this relationship suggests itself"
- "'The Ponds' stresses methodology and the importance of the observer, 'Spring' emphasizes the results."
- focused on "terms of a correspondence between man and nature"
- "Thoreau developed the seasonal emphasis of *Walden* not because eit was the logical structure for his book beceause he was interested in the seasons of his own life"
- "Paradoxically, that we can never have enough of nature and that nature must also be overcome are but different expressions of the same fact, the complexity of our own nature that grows upward and downward at the same time"
"Thoreau is a scientist...who believed that results of his investigations into nature expressed actual and not merely 'poetic' truth"
- Thoreau's sceintific expansions to *Walden* are a subset of the pervasive amplifications drawn from reading and observation"
- "Thoreau's descriptions of the ponds are largely about the process of perception itself, emphasizing that what we see when we look at a body of water is its surface and a boundary where two elements meet"

# Life-Changing Quotes by Thoreau
- pargraph 8 & 9 of Spring 
"The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not a fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic."
- Spring: "So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity."

- "The surface of the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity!"
- "However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man’s abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace."
- "Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul."
- "Only that day dawns to which we are awake."
