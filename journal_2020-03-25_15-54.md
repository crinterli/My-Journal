### Epilogue Notes

- "in the first days of the telegraph, we speak of the annihilation of space and time" (413)
- "Are akk nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to all the globe?" (Walt Whitman, 414)
- "The wiring of the world, followed hard upon by the spread of wireless communication, gave rise to romantic speculation about the birth of a new global organism" (414)
- "The British Muesam embarked on a program of microfilming four thousand of its oldest books. Wells made this prediction: 'In a few score years, there will be thousands of workers at this business of ordering and digesting knowledge where now you have one.'" (415)
- **"It is not the amount of knowledge that make a brain. It is not even the distribution of knowledge. It is the interconnectedness." (416)**
- "The birth of the information theory came with its ruthless sacrifice of meaning--the very quality that gives its value and its purpose." (416)
- "Infinite possibility is good, not bad. Meaningless disorder is to be challenged, not feared. Languae maps a boundless word of objects and sensations and combinations onto a finite space. The wold changes, always mixing the static with the ephemeral, and we know that language changes, not just from edition to edition of the *Oxford English Dictionary*, but from one moment to the next, and from one person to the next." 419)
- "But knowledge in the network is different from group deicision making based on copying and parroting. It seems to develop by accretion: it can give full weight to quirks and exceptions; the challenge is to recognize it and gain access to it...the system apparently discovered outbreaks a week sooner than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" (421)
- **"Their idea was that cyberspace posses a form of self-knowledge, inherent in the links from one page to another, and that a search engine could exploit this knowledge... They considered each link as an expression of value--a reccomendation. And they recognized that not all links are equal... Letting the Internet know how Google work did not hurt Google's ability to leverage the Internet's knowledge" (423)**
- "In cyberspace, almost everything lies in the shadows. Almost everything is connected, too, and the connectedness comes from a relatively few nodes, especially well linked or especially well trusted." (424-5)
- **"We are all patrons of the Library of Babel now, and we are the librarians too. We veer from elation to dismay and back... The library will endure; it it the universe." (426)**
