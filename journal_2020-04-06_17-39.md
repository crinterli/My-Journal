- ctrl + - will reduce the image size
- ctrl + = will scale it up
-  /full/pct:10/ only shows 10% of the original image size while /full/full/ will load the image at its original size
- to display a specific region of an image:
x = the number of pixels from the 0 position of the horizontal axis
y = the number of pixels from the 0 position of the vertical axis
w = the width of the region in pixels
