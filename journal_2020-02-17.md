### Things I Learned Today

**HTML Notes**
- < style > can add color
- CSS formed by a set of rules, such as < h1 >
- declaration: { } change format of HTML elements and they will "set value for a property" by ending with ;
- filtering: the most specific rule takes precdence in CSS
- < strong > gives it priority, no matter the order


**Shell Script Notes**
- "A shell script is bit of code that can run in this shell. Instead of typing the code at the command line every time you want to use it, you can save this bit of code in a file."
- code 'script' will open visual studio code 
- ~ is shorthand for $HOME/writing out whole home directory
- "#!/bin/bash" tells your OS this is a bash file
- "echo Hello World! > hello_world.txt" tells computer to write this in the hello_world.txt file
- "mkdir ~/hello" tells your computer to create a folder named "hello" in your home folder
- "code hello_world.txt" tells it to open the new text file you've created
- ls -l tells you the permissions attached to the file
- up arrow repeats the last thing you typed 
- ./journal.sh will create a new journal file for that day



<style>
     h1 {
       color: blue;
     }
