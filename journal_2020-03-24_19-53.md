### Notes on Chapter 15

- "She placed Gutenberg's invention at center stage: the shift froms script to print; the rise of printing shops in the cities of fifteenth-century Europe; the transformation in 'data collection, storage and retreival system and communications networks'...printing only as *an* agent of change" (399)
- **"As a duplicating machine, the printing press not only made texts cheaper and more accessible; its real power was to make them stable... Before print, scripture was not truly fixed. All forms of knowledge acheived stability and permanence, not because paper was more durable than papyrus but simply becaure there were many copies" (400)**
- "After 'information theory' came to be, so did 'information overload,' 'information glut,' 'information anxiety,' 'information fatigue'... 'Apathy, indifference, or mental exhaustion arising from exposure to too much information'" (403)
- "'Does One Sometimes Know Too Much?'" (405)
- "information overload is real; also, it is both a 'code phase' and a myth. The research can only press onward. Having to think of information as a burden is confusing, as Charles Bennett says, '**We pay to have newspapers delivered, not taken away.**'" (407)
- "For a certain time, collectors, scholars, or fans *possessed* their books and their records. There was a line between what they had and what they did not. For some, the music they owned (or the books, the videos) became a part of who they were. That line fades away. Most of Sophocles' plays are lost, but those that survive are availible at the touch of a button." (409)
- "Too much information, and so much of it is lost. An unindexed Inernet site is in the same limbo as a mishelved book." (410)
- "The balance between creators and consumers is upset: writers and readers, speakers and listeners. Market forces are confused; information can seem too cheap and too expensive at the same time." (412)
