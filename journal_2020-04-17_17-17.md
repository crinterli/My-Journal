### Blog Post Draft

- detailed examples of how your perception changed
- fluid texts, how I saw Thoreau (examples using Voyant tools)
- draft process 
- permanence: no work set in stone/longevity
- with digital age there is a new sense of permanence, books can't be destroyed and knowledge is widespread, but we see past copies of text that can be considered fluid
- the permanent draft is no longer permanent as others can see and post the prior drafts
- example : Solitude
- how technology has shifted the internet and words over time, especially words
- reference Gleick & dictionary development
