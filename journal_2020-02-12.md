### Things I Learned Today

Today I was able to make a rabbit gif appear on my html file. In order to make a gif appear, I learned I needed to make sure that I used the "gif link," not the short link or only the image address. 

**HTML Notes**
- To make a list in html, use "< ul>" but don't end it until the end. For each bullet, use "< li>"
- To make a heading, use < h1> and then < h2> for the secondary
- < !-- tells the browser to ignore what you're writing, use this for styling or to make notes to self
- elements identify different parts of a page (i.e. heading, paragraph)
- tags (specify elements, like < p>)
- < strong> makes it bold
- < img alt="This is an image" src="image.jpeg">  will add alternative text to an image (not viewable in browser, but important for the visually impaired)
- 

#### Command Line Notes
- mkdir: will create a folder
- never type a command that has **sudo** in it, which *can erase your entire hardware*
- echo "This is my cheat sheet" > cheat_sheet.txt (this will put the text in quotes in the file you've created)
- echo "Add this please" >> cheat_sheet.txt (will add more text without overwriting) 
- cat: shows the contents of the file
- code cheat-sheet.txt: will open the file in visual studio code
- | is a pipe, and pipes let you take the output of one command and use it as the input for another
- echo "Hello from the command line" | wc -w: wc counts the words and -w shows it
- cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort: sorts the contents of a file alphabetically
- cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort > new-cheat-sheet.txt: this will save the contents this way
- press "tab" as you start to write something and it will fill it out for you
